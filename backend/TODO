Backend:

!!! HIGH Prio
 * Properly list dependecies

! Low Prio
 * Add option as to only allow EAPOL which contain an authenticated M3

. Nice to have
 * Maybe create a separate class for file conversions. Handle files better
 * Determine if multiple handshakes/PMKIDs are present which one is chosen.

For the cracker:
* Properly list dependecies

Other notes:
Use hcxhashtool for filtering based on mac.
