Backend:

!!! HIGH Prio
 * Properly list dependecies

! Low Prio
 * Add option as to only allow EAPOL which contain an authenticated M3
 * Eliminate aircrack as a dependency. Use hcxtools to check key

. Nice to have
 * Maybe create a separate class for file conversions. Handle files better
 * Determine if multiple handshakes/PMKIDs are present which one is chosen.
 * Test non-printable SSID

For the cracker:
* Work should only be received as 22000 file format. This should simplify the logic by a lot
* Properly list dependecies

Other notes:
Use hcxhashtool for filtering based on mac.
use hcxmactool for conversion from 16800 to 22000 https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-6661-post-47555.html

# tempfile.mkstemp this function might be misused, we might need to use another function
# This funciton is used because of the assumption that the created file is available until manually deleted. Can we
# use another function that deletes the file after references to the filename exist?
# Other functions were not chosen because of the assumption that the created files would have been deleted if
# the crated temp file were to be closed
